1. Thread
Create Thread Thread test1 = new Thread();
		test1.start();

khi mà thread.start() -> JVM sheduled this thread to run
Code to run in the run() method
run(): check the how the object of thread was created. If using default constructor -> return
immediately
in the run code -> not execute in one go. Operating system decides the amount of time to allocate and when to allocate

2. Specify code to run
- Method 1: extends Thread class and override run() method. This method return void
- Method 2: implements Runnable interface and override run() method. After that pass Runnable object to the Thread constructor and start a thread
	+ Using lamdas expression
	+ Using method reference
3. Using multiple threads
- Create 2 threads and start
call start() -> not start right away. -> do some housekeeping before it really can run the thread -> It up to operating system
4. Issues in using multiple threads
Only care when: multiple threads have to coordinate based on some conditions or some shared resources
- Race condition: the out come dependes on the order of threads take place
Okay sử dụng từ khóa synchronize để chi cho phép 1 thread được chạy tại một thời điểm
Sử dụng cho method ở trong Thread class why ?
How synchronize keyword works ?
5. JVM Memory Model

 	Thread 1 <--------------------> Main memory <--------------------> Thread 2
  Working memory for thread 1                                  Working memory for thread 2

Mỗi Thread sẽ có một working memory riêng.
Thread 1 đọc value từ main memory và update but don't write back to main memory
What could happend ?
